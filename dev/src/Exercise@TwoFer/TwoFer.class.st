This is a sample solution for Exercism students.

Of interest, in this example is that classes can define instance methods with the same name, but taking different numbers of parameters.


"
Class {
	#name : 'TwoFer',
	#superclass : 'Object',
	#category : 'Exercise@TwoFer',
	#package : 'Exercise@TwoFer'
}

{ #category : 'example' }
TwoFer >> who [
	^ 'One for you, one for me.'
]

{ #category : 'example' }
TwoFer >> who: aString [ 
	^ 'One for ', aString, ', one for me.'
]
