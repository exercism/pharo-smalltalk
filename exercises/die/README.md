# Die

# Die

Experimental Custom Exercise (Don't use yet)

A small DSL for dice rolling: a nice example to get started with Pharo.


## Hint

It is used in the book: Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo available at http://books.pharo.org


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `die` into the `Exercism | Fetch new exercise` top menu prompt (or right click on any `Exercise@<Name>` package in the Pharo System Browser).

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@Die` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `DieTest`, will test the functionality of `Die`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).

## Language and Environment Help
