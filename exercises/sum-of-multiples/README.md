# Sum Of Multiples

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

## Hint
The trick to this exercise is to understand how to iterate accross an Interval as well as check a Collection for any multiples that are divisible by a number. Try using the Spotter to look up potential classes and browse the categories of methods in those classes. Also remember that the Pharo environment is extensively cross referenced. You can right click on any class or method and browse "references" to a class (to see how it might be created), as well as "senders" of a method (to also see how it might be used). 


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `sum-of-multiples` into the `Exercism | Fetch Exercise` package menu prompt (right click on the Exercism package in the Pharo System Browser). You can also submit your solution from the same menu for any selected package. You don't normally need to use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `SumOfMultiplesTest`, will test the functionality of `SumOfMultiples`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has more detailed help on [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).
